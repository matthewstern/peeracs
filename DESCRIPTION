Title: Assemble ACS data for region and peers
Version: 0.1.0

Description: This function wraps around the tidycensus codeget_acs() function to quietly collect 1 year ACS data for a set of counties, a set of peer MSAs, and the country. It collects data for a range of years, and if asked can iterate through racially-specific detailed census tables. It tracks suppressed data, and attempts to replace suppressed data with 5 year ACS. Finally, it sums or calculates a weighted average for the set of counties. It defaults to CMAP's 7 county region, but this can be overridden for use in other regions.
